Todo List using Javascript(classes,objects,constructors) and Use of webpack.

Objectives:

>The ‘todos’ are going to be objects that we’ll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.

>At a minimum the ‘todos’ should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. We might also want to include notes or even a checklist.

>The todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put.

>Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

>We should separate our application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.

>The todo list should be able to do the following:
    view all projects
    view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
    expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    delete a todo

>Use localStorage to save user’s projects and todos between sessions.
